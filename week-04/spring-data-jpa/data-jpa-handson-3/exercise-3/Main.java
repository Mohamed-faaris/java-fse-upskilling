 * ## Hands on 3
 * Fetch quiz attempt details using HQL In a quiz application there is a requirement for admin to view
 * details of a quiz that an user had attempted. This view should include the following details:
 * Username
 * Attempted Date
 * All questions as part of the attempt
 * List of options under each quiz
 * The option that is correct answer
 * The score for correct answer
 * Schema Diagram Notes on Schema:
 * Tables user, question and options are self explanatory. They hold the respective master data.
 * Tables attempt, attempt_question and attempt_option are used to hold the data of attempts made by
 * each user.
 * Follow steps below to setup the schema:
 * Go to spring-data-jpa-files folder in windows explorer
 * Open file quiz.mwb in MySQL Workbench
 * Generate SQL file using File > Export > Forward Engineer SQL CREATE Script
 * Click Browse and select the file name and folder for the saving the generated SQL file
 * Select the check box "Generate INSERT Statements for Tables"
 * Click Next > Next > Finish to generate the SQL file
 * Execute the SQL file in ormlearn schema and check the data in the tables
 * ## Steps to get this implemented:
 * Create necessary entity class for each table defined above
 * Define necessary O/R mapping based on the schema defined above​​​
 * Create a Repository and Service class:
 * AttemptRepository
 * public Attempt getAttempt(int userId, int attemptId)
 * AttemptService
 * public Attempt getAttempt(int userId, int attemptId)
 * Modify OrmLearnApplication.java to include a new test method and test
 * AttemptService.getAttemptDetail() method
 * Create HQL that joins the tables in the below order:
 * user
 * attempt
 * attempt_question
 * question
 * attempt_option
 * options
 * In the HQL include where class for userId and attemptId
 * Include 'fetch' in HQL wherever there is one-to-many or many-to-many relationship
 * In OrmLearnApplication.java test method ​​​​​​get the attempts details, iterate through the details
 * and display the data in the following format. The second column in each option denotes the score
 * from question table. The last column in each option denotes the answer selected by the user.
